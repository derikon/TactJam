# Call for Participation
In this studio, we focus on designing vibrotactile patterns (tactons) for the whole body. These
tactons enable conveying non-visual information to users that can be beneficial in many scenarios
where overloading the user with visual information should be avoided (e.g., driving). While one
can design tactons with various comprehensive tools, we adopt a more hands-on approach and
propose to design them using an instrument-like device we call TactJam. Such a device is easy to
master and does not require any knowledge in tactile feedback.

This studio is made for any person interested in designing tactons to be experienced on the
whole body. We do not restrict applications from a certain population of the HCI community, but
rather hope that many researchers or hobbyists from diverse backgrounds would attend.

The aim of this studio is to organize collaborative ideation sessions focused on the design of
tactons. Using the TactJam devices, all attendees will be able to design and feel the tactons they
came up with, but also from all others. We hope to generate discussions on various strategies to
create such patterns, as well as ideal placement of the actuators on the body based on users’
sensibility.

By the end of the studio, attendees will know about tactons and their uses in general. They
will have experienced and designed novel vibrotactile patterns using a simple instrument-like
device, and would have shared their creative process with others. The authors will keep the library
of tactons created and report the results of the ideation sessions on the studio’s website.
