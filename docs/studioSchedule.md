# STUDIO SCHEDULE
The studio is a one-day online event and will last about six hours
divided into three sessions – *think, pair*, and *share* (see Sec. 2). To
accommodate multiple time-zones we offer two exemplary sched-
ules – one optimized for Europe and Asia (see first row in Table 1)
and the other optimized for Europe and Americas (see second row
in Table 1). Only one of the two schedules will be eventually used.
The start can be adjusted later on, depending on the demand of
participants and where they are located on Earth. Therefore, the
organizers will start a poll at the latest one week before the event.
The detailed schedule is shown in Table 2.

Since a pure online event can be very exhausting for the par-
ticipants, the organizers have tried to keep the schedule flexible.
In addition to some breaks, there will also be sections in which
the participants do not necessarily have to be online (e.g. while
composing tactons). The organizers will however be available all
the time for questions.
