# STUDIO PROPOSAL
We plan to host the studio for enthusiastic participants to compose
and experience tactons. Therefore, each participant will be provided
with a ready to use TactJam device. Due to the limited number of
available devices we have to limit the workshop to 16 participants.
Participation without a device may not be practical to achieve the
proposed learning objectives.

After a general introduction to the studio’s topic and some
grounding in theory, we plan to structure the studio into three
major consecutive sessions: (1) think, (2) pair, (3) share (see Fig. 2).
During the *think-session* participants will get familiar with TactJam
and freely experiment with it. They will compose and experience
spatial vibrotactile patterns produced in real-time. The goal for this
session is to teach participants basic concepts of tactons, and how
they can play with TactJam to compose them.

For the *pair-session* participants will come together in small
remote groups using the Discord chat application and map the
intention of given visual pictograms into tactons. They will share
and discuss their strategies to compose tactons in their groups and
eventually vote for the best solutions or create entirely new ones
by merging ideas. All produced tactons and discussions will be
processed and saved in a Git repository and a dedicated wiki by the
organizers to document the progress during the studio afterwards.

During the *share-session*, participants will present their strategies
and share their tactons with all other groups. They will have the
time to share their personal bodily experiences with TactJam and
reflect on the creation process to compose tactons. Ideally, all par-
ticipants will end this session with a list of dos and don’ts in mind
when composing tactons. These are also documented in the wiki
by the organizers. We would also like to encourage the participants
to summarize their impressions and findings in a short paragraph,
which will be published in the wiki by the organizers.

Based on the quality of the empirical data, we plan on writing a 
scientific paper aimed at a renowned HCI conference (TEI, CHI or
others) or rather opt for an article in a magazine like Interactions.
The results remain accessible after the studio and all sources will
be licensed under Open Source or Creative Commons (depending
on type of source).
